## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning
- **Goal**: Establish the foundation for development.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up GitHub repository for version control.
  - Define tech stack (e.g., React Native/Flutter for mobile, Node.js/Express for backend, MongoDB/PostgreSQL for database).
  - Register for Spotify Developer Account and obtain API credentials.
  - Create wireframes/mockups for core UI (feed, profile, music player).
  - Outline core features: user authentication, music playback, posts with Spotify tracks, follow system, music-based recommendations.
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 2: Core Development (MVP)
- **Goal**: Build a minimum viable product with essential features.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Backend**:
    - Set up server and database (e.g., Express with MongoDB).
    - Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth with Spotify).
    - Integrate Spotify API for music playback and user music data (top tracks, playlists).
  - **Frontend**:
    - Develop basic UI: home feed, user profile, post creation with Spotify track embedding.
    - Implement music player to preview Spotify tracks in posts.
  - **Features**:
    - Users can log in with Spotify.
    - Users can create posts with attached Spotify tracks.
    - Basic feed to display posts from followed users.
  - Test core functionality (post creation, music playback).
- **Duration**: 4-6 weeks

### Phase 3: Social & Music Features
- **Goal**: Enhance social and music-based interactions.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement follow/unfollow system.
  - Add music taste matching (recommend users based on shared top artists/tracks).
  - Develop comment and like functionality for posts.
  - Create a "Discover" page for finding users with similar music tastes.
  - Optimize Spotify API calls for performance (e.g., caching user data).
- **Duration**: 3-4 weeks

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- **Goal**: Refine the app and ensure reliability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Improve UI/UX based on user feedback or testing.
  - Fix bugs and optimize performance (e.g., reduce API call latency).
  - Conduct user testing with a small group to validate features.
  - Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android (if using cross-platform framework).
  - Add basic error handling (e.g., Spotify API rate limits, offline mode).
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks

### Phase 5: Deployment & Initial Launch
- **Goal**: Launch the MVP to a small user base.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy backend to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel).
  - Publish mobile app to app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store).
  - Set up basic analytics to track user engagement (e.g., Firebase Analytics).
  - Promote app to early adopters (e.g., music communities, social media).
- **Duration**: 2 weeks

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Add group chats or music-based communities.
- Integrate real-time notifications for likes, comments, and follows.
- Allow users to create and share playlists.
- Implement advanced recommendation algorithms for music and user connections.
- Add support for video posts with music overlays.

**Total Estimated Timeline**: ~12-17 weeks for MVP

**Next Steps**:
1. Initialize the repository and add this roadmap to your README.
2. Start with Phase 1: Set up your development environment and Spotify API access.
3. Break down tasks into GitHub Issues for tracking progress.
